## Scrabble - Backend
This project is a Scrabble-like multiplayer game built using a Ruby-on-Rails backend
server and a vanilla Javascript frontend with custom CSS styling. Two-players can
play on a fully interactive tile board with automatic scoring using a complex algorithm.
Tiles are automatically generated from a set pool of letters and distributed randomly.


This is a project in collaboration with Damon Collins (https://github.com/d-collins2).
